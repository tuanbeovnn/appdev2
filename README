# this is the first version

This project is to trun a Rasberry PI as an audio device. The device is able to do 2 functions: as a sound collector and as a test-tone
generator

----------------------------------------------------

The application is running on a Rasberry PI 3 model B.
This Pi should come with a USB sound card, network connection, a microphone.
1) Configuaration Instructions
1.1 Configer USB sound card as default audio device.
	- In default, the Rasberry PI 3 does not have a sound card, so we need appy the sound card by adding USB sound card.
	- After adding sound card, we need to check USB sound card which is mounted and use command line as below: lsusb
	- Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf”command and put following content to the file:
	pcm.!default {
		type plug
		slave {
			pcm "hw:1,0"
		}
	}
	ctl.!default {
		type hw
		card 1
	}
	- Moreover, using command “nano .asoundrc” command and put the same content to the file.
	
	- Run “alsamixer” you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device, and we should use maximum volume of Mic. 
1.2 How to install libcurl
	- First of all, we use the command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed.
	- In case of the folder does not exits. Run command “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
	- Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
	- Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.
2) Installation Instructions
	- Insert the SD card and install Raspbian OS through this website:https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/
and download "Noobs" image and remember to download ZIP file.

	- For the first time boot, plug in your keyboard, mouse and monitor cable. Then, you disable a display with RPi
because it will be more convinient and you don't use it in most cases. Furthermore, you also need to know its IP address 
when using RPi remotely. For more information about NOOBS setup, you can find at: https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/
	
	- Disassemble keyboard, mouse and monitor cable and plug them back in your computer.Then, insert USB sound card and microphone 
	to the Raspberry Pi and connect RPi to a Internet domain by the RJ45 cable. After that, connect to power supply by Micro USB to USB cable. 
	
	- Using IP address sent by email to connect to the terminal.
3) Operating Intructors
	- After the installation, simply execute "./sound.out" in the project folder.
	- Open the PUTTY terminal and logging in your IP address you recieved. So you "login as:" pi and enter your password.
	- Get access to "appdev" folder by "cd appdev/" command. In "appdev", enter "cd appdev1/" command to access to appdev1 folder where all
	the source code files are put in.
	- There are many useful commands you need to know to easily get access to those file:
		+"mkdir": Make a new folder
		+ "ls -l": show the files of current folder in details 
		+"cd..": Change to parent folder
		+"cd $HOME": Change to the root folder of current user
		+"rm": Delete a file or a number of files/folders
		+"scp": Copy files from one host to another host
		+ "tar": make multiple files into one so that we can store them more efficiently.
		+"cd $HOME":change to the root folder of current user
		+"cp": duplicate file(s)/folder(s) from one folder to another
		+"grep": Find information which contains specific key word(s)
		For more information, you can find at: http://www.circuitbasics.com/useful-raspberry-pi-commands/
	- Compilling program by typing "make" command
	- After the installation, simply execute "./sound.out" in the project folder.
	- Addition, you can use "./sound.out 440" or "./sound.out 1000" to run 
4) File list (Manifest)
	- The project contains following files: 
	--README.md : This file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. 
	--makefile : The makefile of this project 
	--sound.c : The module containing functions about sound processing 
	--sound.h : The header of sound.c 
	--screen.c : The module containing functions about screen manipulation 
	--screen.h : The header of screen.c 
	--comm.c : The communication module using libcurl 
	--comm.h : The header file of comm.c 
	--main.c : This file is the operating file which call all other functions and execute in a typical order.
	--curltest.c: This file is used to transfer data from or to a server, using common Internet protocol.
	--sound.php : The server page to receive data.

	In conclusion, I have learned a lot of knowledge from teacher about how to create a application as well as use linex command. On the other hands, I will learn another lessons from Internet to improve knowledge
and create more application in the future.
